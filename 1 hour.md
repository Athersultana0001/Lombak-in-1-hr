# Lombak in 1 hr

Certainly! Here are the same examples with emojis added for each session in the Lombok course outline:

## 1. Introduction to Lombok üëã (7 minutes)
![Introduction to Lombok - Everything Java](https://www.everything-java.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/LombokFeaturedImage.png)


**Content:** Welcome to the Lombok course! In this course, you'll learn about a powerful Java library called Lombok that simplifies Java development by reducing boilerplate code.

**Example:** Imagine you have a simple Java class `Person`:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    // Getters and setters
}
```

With Lombok, you can achieve the same functionality with just this:
```java
import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```

## 2. What is Lombok? ü§î (7 minutes)
![Lombok Java - Javatpoint](https://static.javatpoint.com/core/images/lombok-java.png)


**Content:** Lombok is a library that eliminates repetitive and verbose Java code by providing annotations to generate common code structures automatically.

**Example:** Show a code snippet with and without Lombok's `@Getter` annotation to illustrate how Lombok generates getter methods for class fields.

## 3. Setting Up Lombok üõ†Ô∏è (7 minutes)
![Eclipse, Spring Tool Suite, (Red Hat) JBoss Developer Studio, MyEclipse](https://projectlombok.org/img/lombok-installer.png)


**Content:** To use Lombok, you need to add it as a dependency in your project, configure your IDE, and verify the setup.

**Example:** Provide step-by-step instructions for adding Lombok to a Maven or Gradle project, setting up your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA), and ensuring Lombok is working correctly.

## 4. Lombok Annotations üèóÔ∏è (10 minutes)
![Lombok advanced features](https://i0.wp.com/technicalsand.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Lombok-advanced-features-annotations.jpg?fit=960%2C540&ssl=1)


**Content:** Discuss common Lombok annotations like `@Data`, `@Builder`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, and `@AllArgsConstructor`.

**Example:** Show how `@Data` generates getters, setters, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods. Demonstrate how `@Builder` simplifies object creation.

## 5. Reducing Boilerplate Code üì¶ (7 minutes)
![What Is A Boilerplate In Programming? - ThemeSelection](https://q4y2k3w9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/boilerplate-in-programming-thegem-blog-default.png)


**Content:** Explore scenarios where Lombok reduces code duplication, such as generating getters and setters.

**Example:** Compare a class with manually written getters and setters to the same class with Lombok-generated getters and setters.

## 6. Lombok‚Äôs Limitations üè≠ (4 minutes)
![Using Lombok in Spring Boot - DEV Community](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---oYqLXjm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/mg4s5hy132rtkkzapttt.png)


**Content:** Discuss scenarios where Lombok might not be suitable, like complex inheritance hierarchies or legacy code.

**Example:** Explain a case where Lombok's automatic generation might lead to unexpected behavior and how to handle it manually.

## 7. Advanced Lombok Features üß© (10 minutes)

**Content:** Cover advanced Lombok annotations like `@SneakyThrows`, `@Value`, and `@Wither`.

**Example:** Demonstrate how `@SneakyThrows` simplifies exception handling and how `@Value` generates immutable classes.

## 8. Best Practices and Tips üí° (5 minutes)

**Content:** Share best practices like documenting code and ensuring compatibility with other libraries when using Lombok.

**Example:** Provide a code sample that follows best practices, including clear annotations and documentation.

## 9. Q&A Session ‚ùì (5 minutes)
![How to improve the Q&A Session at Your Next Event](https://cdn.eventplanner.net/imgs/rt8091_how-to-improve-the-qa-session-at-your-next-event@2x.jpg)


**Content:** Open the floor for participant questions and provide detailed answers and explanations.

**Example:** Answer participant questions regarding Lombok usage, troubleshooting, or any topic covered in the course.

## 10. Conclusion and Next Steps üö™ (3 minutes)
